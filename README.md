# Files app

A personal project.
The application uses the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest) to show a list of files.

⚠️ Don't forget to setup your own [API Client ID](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#oauth-client-id), [API Scheme](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#oauth-client-id) and Google SpreadsheetId ID in the `Configuration` file.
